Anesthesia care was administered. Once sedation reached desired levels, a manual rectal examination was done, revealing no detectable masses or external rectal issues. A lubricated endoscope was smoothly inserted and directed up to the cecum, confirmed by spotting the ileocecal valve and the opening to the appendix. A thorough check of the ascending, transverse, and descending parts of the colon was conducted in a reverse and encompassing manner. A singular small polyp was identified in the sigmoid colon and was safely excised using a cold biopsy technique. Additionally, slight diverticulosis was observed in the sigmoid region. No other irregularities were seen. A backward view within the rectal chamber disclosed no inner anomalies of the anal passage. Following the examination, the endoscope was carefully removed and the patient was moved to recovery.",
